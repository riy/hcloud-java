# Hetzner Cloud API - Java Client

A Java wrapper for the Hetzner Cloud API. Easily interact with the Hetzner Cloud API using this library.

This is version 0.1-SNAPSHOT and work in progress. Please feel free to submit pull requests.

### How to use

Create a server instance in your Hetzner Cloud Console and name it `hcloud-java-testserver`. Get an API token, clone this repository and run `./gradlew build -Dtoken=<Your Hetzner Cloud API token>` in your shell to build the code and run the tests.

### How to help

Please check out the APIs that are completed and work on whatever's missing.
